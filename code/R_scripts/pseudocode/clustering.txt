#clustering CRMS pseudocode

Goals: go through peak csv files, find clusters of TFs (presumably sort out if it makes biological sense afterward?)
	-what is a cluster
		-call any single TF a cluster of one
		-any TFs within 1kb of each other a cluster
		
	-make a class peak (put this in a module!)
		-variables 
			-TF name, peak coord min and max, peak strength, other info
		-methods
			-create peak
			-get coords of peak
			
	-make a class cluster
		-variables
			-range (-0.5kb-+0.5kb the furthest spread apart cluster members), contents class peak
		-methods
			-create cluster
			-get range
			-add to cluster
			-print cluster
		

make a dictionary of clusters (there will be as many clusters as their are peaks, because cluster size min is 1 TF)
