### Background ###

Recent Furlong paper really went a long way toward addressing the story of predicting shadow enhancers using genomic features, and addressing their frequency throughout the genome.

I'm planning to split my two chapters up into two papers (much like my committee suggested) so I'm not telling the same story.

These will address:
* Use of machine learning to predict enhancers in early stage   Drosophila embryos, using the Stark labs Fly Enhancer resource as a training set, and *many* genomic features as predictors. Will look at influence of various features on prediction success, etc. Since I'm not addressing evolution/motifs in the same chapter or manuscript, I've also incorporated them as predictors.


* Evolution of enhancers as addressed through multiple measurements (from sequence conservation to binding potential), and how that relates to their known functions. Will look at the shadow enhancer question (which was also addressed in the Furlong paper) in greater depth.
